-> Folder Non Trending Data Extraction contains all the files used to extract the Non trending video dataset.
-> category_id is a json file containing the details of all the categories, which is used to convert the category Ids into its category names.
-> NonTrendingVidoes and TrendingVideos CSV files contain the data used for training and testing of data.
-> channel_dict is pickle file containing the dictionary of channel ID to channel name. It is used to convert the channel IDs of non trending videos into channel names.
-> youTubeTrendingVideoPrediction contains the python code. The code can be executed in Anaconda Spyder.
-> When youTubeTrendingVideoPrediction is executed, it fetches the data, preprocess it and trains the model and produces the output.
-> The output is threefold, first it the model is built using Logistic Regression and then using KNN Classfication. 
	In the end some of the patterns is seen in the dataset is shown.
-> The code approxiamately takes 30 seconds to run.
